#Task-->>>>
#          The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.

# Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a // b. The second line should contain the result of float division,  a/b .

# No rounding or formatting is necessary.

a = int(input("Please enter the number: "))
b = int(input("Please enter the second number: "))
Int_D = a//b
f_d = a/b
    
print(Int_D)
print(f_d)
